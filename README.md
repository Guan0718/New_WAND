# WAND v2.0

Welcome to Wand 2.0. 

Wand 1.0 was initially created as a hobby project by SpikeMogo @ Spike as he was too lazy to play maple manually. Hours of grinding ? No way. Anyway, let's cut to the chase shall we ?

The main difference between Wand2.0 from the predecessor is its ability to go full background, having multiple bots running together on the same desktop without using separate VMs. Previously, Wand1.0 needed to control mouse / keyboard which you could not use your computer once the bot started running.

With Wand2.0, new sets / clearer APIs are introduced which makes this bot extremely versatile and customizable according to one's own needs.
