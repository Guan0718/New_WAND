# WAND v2.0 Introductory  

Wand 1.0 was initially created as a hobby project by **SpikeMogo @ Spike** as he was too lazy to play maple manually. **Hours of grinding ? No way**. Anyway, let's cut to the chase shall we ?

The main difference between Wand2.0 from the predecessor is its **ability to go full background**, having multiple bots running together on the same desktop without using separate VMs. Previously, Wand1.0 needed to control mouse / keyboard which you could not use your computer once the bot started running.

With Wand2.0, **new sets / clearer APIs** are introduced which makes this bot **extremely versatile and customizable** according to one's own needs.

**Wand2.0 Features**
1. Full background botting
    - Ability to bot / grind / level in full background mode
    - Ability to sell items via packets
    - Ability to buy items via packets
    - Ability to filter equips based on stats by creating a whitelist in LUA language
    - Ability to embed maplestory into WAND so you could open multiple clients / bots
