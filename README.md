# WAND v2.0 Introductory  

**Wand 1.0** was initially created as a hobby project by **SpikeMogo @ Spike** as he was too lazy to play maple manually. **Hours of grinding? No way**. Anyway, let's cut to the chase shall we?

The main difference between Wand 2.0 and it's predecessor WAND 1.0 is its **ability to bot in the background**, having multiple bots running together on the same desktop without using separate VMs. Previously, Wand 1.0 needed to control the mouse and keyboard so you could not use your computer once the bot started running.

With Wand 2.0, **New Scripts and clearer APIs** are introduced which makes this bot **extremely versatile and customizable** according to one's own needs.

**Wand 2.0 Features**
- `` Full background botting`` 
- `` Discord bot``
- `` Ability to script your own custom functions and logic (you could do this previously, of course), enabling you to create all sorts of scripts`` 
- `` Ability to bot / grind in full background mode / while minimized`` 
- `` Ability to sell items via packets`` 
- `` Ability to buy items via packets`` 
- `` Ability to filter equips based on stats by creating a whitelist.`` 
- `` Ability to embed maplestory into WAND so you could open multiple clients / bots``
